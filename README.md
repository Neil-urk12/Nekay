# 💕 Nekay - A Love-Powered Productivity App

Built with Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite (and lots of love! 💝)

## What's This All About?

Nekay is a delightful personal companion app I crafted for my girlfriend, because sometimes "I love you" is best expressed in code! 👩‍💻
A beautiful and cute girl needs a cute and fun app too! 💕

### Features That Make It Special:

- ⏰ **Pomodoro Timer**: Because time flies when you're being productive (or thinking about your significant other)
- 📝 **Task Management**: Keep track of todos, even if "Kiss my boyfriend" is always at the top of the list
- 📓 **Journal Entries**: A digital space to capture thoughts, dreams, and maybe a few complaints about my coding habits
- 🌡️ **Breathing Exercises**: For when I'm not around to give calming hugs
- 💧 **Water Tracker**: Stay hydrated! (Because love isn't the only thing you need to survive)

## Technical Sweet Nothings

- Built with Vue 3 + TypeScript for type-safe love declarations
- Vite for lightning-fast builds (almost as fast as my heart beats when she uses the app)
- PWA-enabled for offline functionality (because our love doesn't need an internet connection)
- IndexedDB for local data persistence (like memories, but digital)
- Firebase backend for real-time sync (keeping us connected, one commit at a time)
